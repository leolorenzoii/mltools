# `mltools`: Your one stop shop for all your ML1 Models!
Are you tired of copy pasting ML codes scattered accross different notebooks? Want to run machine learning models but don't know how to iterate and cross validate your models? Don't know how to interpret the results of your model? Don't fret cause `mltools` got the tools that you need!

This library/code contains all the learnings taken from the ML1 class and some more. This includes all the machine learning models used, the cross validation strategy, interpretability strategies, and many more! The code was designed to be beginner friendly, easy to use, easy to integrate, and encourage collaboration across team members!

Please check the `recipe-book.ipynb` or `recipe-book.html` for a sample usage of `mltools.py`!
